As of Feb 3rd, 2016:
- Instead of using YAML, use JSON for configuration files.
- (?) Use NOXCATFS/0.1 Java driver for files?
  -> Would mean would have to make a utility to easily edit configuration.
     Maybe just use NOXCATFS for internal files, instead of config?
  -> NOXCATFS may fork into a separate plugin in the future
